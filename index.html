                    <h2> About Me</h2>
                    <p> Hello everyone! Welcome to my website. My name is Nivedita Amanjee, and I go by Nivi. I live in Roseville and go to college at both American River College and Sierra College. I am studying Computer Science while learning web development at a bootcamp in UC Davis.</p>
                    <p> As I explore the avenues of my life, I also explore myself and the qualities I bring to my work. So far, I have discovered my love for children while working as a behavioral therapist at Center for Austism and Related Disorders and my hunger for helping people in developing their projects while working as a Business Development Intern at Blue Line Arts, an art gallery in Roseville. Now, I am discovering that I can hone in my qualities of patience, attention to detail, creativity, and desire to collaborate with other people as I build my skills in the world of technology.</p>
                    <p> In my free time, I enjoy painting, writing, singing, dancing, watching mindless comedy TV shows, and spending time with my friends and pondering all the random businesses we could start. Hopefully one day, one of those ideas will become a reality. </p>
